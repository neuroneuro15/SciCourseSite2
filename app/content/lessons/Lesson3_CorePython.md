## Lesson Goals
  - Become comfortable working in the Python console.
  - Understand what a variable is, and the different core data types: int, float, char, str, bool
  - Understand how and when to use if-else statements and while loops
  - Understand how to use functions, and how to access and read the help documentation for functions
  - Understand how to write a Python script.


## Sample Code

Variables of Different Types:

    a = 3
    b = 3.14
    c = "hello"
    d = True
    e = (2, 3, 4, 1, 10)
    f = (1, "hi", True, 4.2)


If-Else:

    if a > 2:
        print("A is big!")
    else:
        print("a is small.")

Functions:

    max((1, 4, 6, 2))
