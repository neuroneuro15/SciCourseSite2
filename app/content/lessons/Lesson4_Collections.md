summary: Iteration is the key to saving you time and improving your reliability. Here we'll cover lists, tuples, and for-loops

# Scripts are Great

There are several reasons why we write scripts:

  - They are easy to use
  - They can be easily shared
  - They save us time!

# Markdown is useful

Here is an example of a code block:


    import numpy as np

    x = 3
    y = np.arange(0, 10, 2)
    sinx = x * np.sin(y)
    print(sinx)


Looks good, doesn't it?  **Doesn't it?!**
