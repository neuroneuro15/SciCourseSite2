title: Final Project Assignment and Grading Rubric


## Project Goal
Demonstrate understanding of the Python programming language and its scientific packages by creating and emailing me a Jupyter Notebook containing an original analysis of a dataset of your choice.  This can be your own data from your lab, a colleague's data, or even data from some open database on the internet.

## Deadline
December 1, 2016

## Rubrik

Notebooks will be graded using the following rubrik (total: 85 Points):

  - **Use of Appropriate Data Structures** (10 Points):
    - All data is of the appropriate type, and is organized in a manner that is succinct and has performance requirements associated with the goals of the analysis
ex) use of floats for floating point data and strings for labels, using NumPy arrays and Pandas DataFrames for collecting large-scale data

  - **Readable Coding Style** (10 Points):
    - Variables are named following the Python conventions (ex: “subjects” instead of “s”)
    - Spaces between operators
    - for-loops use the “For Each” iteration style
    - Important lines are commented.

  - **The Analysis is Documented** (10 Points):
    - Markdown Cells are used between code sections to explain the goals of each part of the analysis, and an introduction is given explaining the nature of the data.
    - Bolding, headings, and lists are used to make the sections more legible.

  - **There are 3 Different Plot Types, Properly Labeled** (30 Points):
    - Three different plots should be made from the data
      - ex) Bar plot, histogram, scatter plot
    - All axes should be labeled, and the plot in general should be attractive and simple to understand.

  - **All Required Packages are Used** (5 Points per Package: 25 Points):
    - os and os.path
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    - scipy-stats
